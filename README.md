# Plethora

Plethora is a web-app that allow the user to add his/her favorite tv-shows or movies to a favorite list or a watch-list, making sure not to lose any exciting new show. I create this project in order to practice and gain confidence on the concepts learned on **React**, like _hooks_, _router_ and with the use of _Sass_ to manage all the styles. I used the _TMDB API_ to fetch the latest movie/tv-series for the different pages and with a custom search, fetching results based on the user input for shows or actors. Once a show is clicked it opens a page with all the info about it where the user can choose to add that show to a favorite list or to a watch-list.
